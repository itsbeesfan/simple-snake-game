## simple snake game - by beesfan
this is a classic snake game inspired by the freecodecamp snake game tutorial!

## features
- retro style snake game
- title game (with art made by me!!! im not an artist but i tried my very best)
- high score

### soon to be added features! (maybe)
- leaderboard
- themes (different color palettes)
- different grid sizes

## thanks and getting started
work in progress (maybe, if people like this enough i might add the other features). **suggestions and
feedback are happily appreciated**
